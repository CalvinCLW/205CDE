                    <p>Based in Melbourne, one of the world’s best coffee cities, the Company’s Founder is very passionate about engaging with people through coffee. He has been traveling around connecting with people of diverse cultures through coffee.</p>
                    <p>Originating from Penang, Malaysia, he sees a resemblance between Melbourne and Penang in many aspects. Not only both are the second largest cities in their respective countries, they are the center of tourism, arts, heritage, food and murals. In recent years, cafés have been mushrooming in Penang.</p>
                    <p>Practically at every corner and every street, there are artisanal cafés of unique characters. Such scene is again pretty similar as in Melbourne.</p>

                    <p>The surge in café industry results in the rise in coffee standard, expectation and quality in Penang. As the Company’s Founder fondly inscribed during a coffee forum during the International Halal Expo <i>“While Melbourne is the globally renowned coffee city, Penang is emerging as an international coffee city in Asia”</i>.</p>
                    <p>Coffee inevitably is re-shaping the future economic landscape of Penang to some extent. This belief inspires the birth of Roastery Sdn Bhd, fondly known as Roastery.</p>
